# Spinning Cube

This project is a simple ASCII art spinning cube rendered in the terminal using C. The cube rotates in 3D space, and different faces of the cube are displayed using various ASCII characters and colors.

## Features

- 3D rotation of a cube in the terminal.
- Different ASCII characters represent different faces of the cube.
- Colorful output using ANSI escape codes.
- Adjustable rotation speed and viewer distance.

## Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
- A terminal that supports ANSI escape codes.

   git clone https://github.com/martindios/spinningCube.git
